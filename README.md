#Log
This log will document my workflow throughout the course as well as be a platform for Dr. Barshis to follow my progress.
Created log repository:
https://github.com/Getterrobog/Log.git
I ran the commands Dan instructed.  From now I need to remember the following:
git add README.md 
git commit -m "insert relevant comment"
git push -u origin main
